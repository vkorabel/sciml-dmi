What do we want SciML DMI to be? . mindmap SciML DMI getting practal advise on using &quot;pascal&quot; would like to learn about ML, have money brainstorm practical examples, feedback keep up to date with recent developments pioneer new things at DMI have fun! go through interesting papers, show the front page tie in new people with ML experience, support network learn techniques being applied in group best practice for using ML in operations? existing projects, what ML is being used? DEODE DestineE emulation PhD student, innovation fund, Phillip Arestrup DTU data quality analysis for Danish APA sattellite data, sea ice mapping in radar images flood mapping, by external partners Anna, densification of shallow ice cores, DTU Space physical foundation of machine learning? use of ML at data assimilation? . GPUs? . platform name, hardware available, cost, how to get access . | pascal.dmi.dk, 1x A100 80GB (paid for by IT during ASIP project, Tore Wulf) only available to ASIP group (Ask Tore Wulf twu@dmi.dk, Martin Koster mak@dmi.dk), cost ~ 100,000DKK Tore Wulf: research group is pushing for more copies of pascal.dmi.dk | . | ATOS @ ECMWF: should be easy to get access (KAH) | European Weather Cloud | LUMI | EuroHPC: nvidia | upcoming project needs: Ruth: emulate regional climate model over two ice sheets - do we need more GPUs? | Fabrizio (EUMETNET project) | . | no GPU UWC-W | .
